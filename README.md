Sure, here are some potential viva questions and answers for a practical exam on Web Technology:

1. What is HTML, and what are some of its key elements?
Answer: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to create the structure and content of web pages. Some of its key elements include headers, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.

2. How does CSS differ from HTML, and what is it used for?
Answer: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Unlike HTML, which is used to create the structure and content of a web page, CSS is used to define the visual style of a web page, including its layout, typography, and colors.

3. What is the purpose of JavaScript, and how does it differ from HTML and CSS?
Answer: JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It differs from HTML and CSS in that it can manipulate the content and behavior of a web page in response to user input or other events.

4. What is the Document Object Model (DOM), and how does it relate to JavaScript?
Answer: The DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to manipulate the content and behavior of a web page in real time.

5. What is the difference between a client-side and a server-side script?
Answer: A client-side script runs in the user's web browser, whereas a server-side script runs on the web server. Client-side scripts are used to provide dynamic behavior and interactivity on the user's end, while server-side scripts are used to process data and generate dynamic content before it is sent to the user's browser.

6. What is a web server, and how does it relate to the HTTP protocol?
Answer: A web server is a program that receives requests from web clients (such as web browsers) and returns responses. The HTTP protocol is the standard for communication between web clients and servers, and it defines the format and meaning of requests and responses.

7. What is a database, and how can it be used in web development?
Answer: A database is a structured collection of data that can be queried and manipulated using special programming languages such as SQL. Databases can be used in web development to store and retrieve data for use on web pages or to implement user authentication and other advanced features.

8. What is a web application framework, and how can it simplify web development?
Answer: A web application framework is a software library or toolset that provides a standard structure and set of conventions for building web applications. It can simplify web development by automating common tasks such as routing, form handling, and database interactions, and by providing a consistent and secure foundation for web development projects.


Sure, here are some possible viva questions and their answers related to PHP and web technology:

1. What is PHP?
Answer: PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used to create dynamic web pages and web applications. It is an open-source language that is widely used for web development.

2. What is a server-side script?
Answer: A server-side script is a script that runs on the server rather than on the client's browser. It generates dynamic content and interacts with databases or other server-side services to produce web pages.

3. What are the benefits of using PHP?
Answer: Some benefits of using PHP include its open-source nature, its ease of use and integration with HTML, its support for a wide range of databases, and its flexibility and scalability.

4. How do you start a PHP script?
Answer: To start a PHP script, you need to include the opening PHP tag <?php at the beginning of the script and the closing PHP tag ?> at the end. You can then add PHP code between these tags.

5. What is a variable in PHP?
Answer: A variable in PHP is a container that stores a value or a reference to a value. Variables can be used to store and manipulate data, such as strings, numbers, and arrays.

6. How do you declare a variable in PHP?
Answer: To declare a variable in PHP, you use the $ symbol followed by the variable name. For example, $name = "John"; declares a variable named $name and assigns it the value "John".

7. What is the difference between GET and POST methods in PHP?
Answer: The GET and POST methods are used to send data from a web form to the server. The main difference between them is that GET sends the data in the URL, while POST sends the data in the HTTP request body. GET is generally used for retrieving data, while POST is used for submitting data to a server for processing.

8. What is a session in PHP?
Answer: A session in PHP is a way to store and retrieve data between multiple requests from the same client. It allows you to keep track of user information, such as login credentials or shopping cart items, without having to store the information in cookies or HTML forms.

9. What is the difference between include and require in PHP?
Answer: Both include and require are used to include PHP files into another PHP file. The main difference between them is that require will produce a fatal error if the file cannot be found, while include will only produce a warning.

10. What is a database in PHP?
Answer: A database in PHP is a collection of data that is stored in a structured format. PHP provides a wide range of database support, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. Databases can be used to store and retrieve data for web applications, such as user accounts, product listings, or customer orders.

I hope these questions and answers help you prepare for your PHP practical viva tomorrow. Good luck!
